You need to connect to the WebRTC session from two different browsers, which would then share video and audio P2P using WebRTC.

To start the app
 
  * Clone this repository 
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
